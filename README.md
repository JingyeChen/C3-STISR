# :sparkles: C3-STISR :sparkles:
Official Code for 'C3-STISR: Scene Text Image Super-resolution with Triple Clues'

IJCAI 2022 Accepted Paper 

The code will be gradually open source!

Due to company policy, I can't provide the code. To guarantee reproducibility, I am working on reimplement C3-STISR. The final result will be released around September. Thank you all for your support.
