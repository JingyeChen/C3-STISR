# :sparkles: C3-STISR :sparkles:
Official Code for 'C3-STISR: Scene Text Image Super-resolution with Triple Clues'

IJCAI 2022 Accepted Paper 

The code will be gradually open source!

Due to company policy, I can't provide the code. To guarantee reproducibility, I am working on reimplement C3-STISR. The final result will be released around September. Thank you all for your support.

Since a lot of my works (including reviewing papers) are written in one framework, I decide not to release the complete code. Instead, following items are released for reproducibility:

- model scrits

- training scripts

- log

- final pth (accessed via email request)

You can find the rest codes in TPGSR, TATT and STT.

## :flushed: Difference between the paper :flushed:

- Visual clue is removed since it does not help improving recognition performance.

- Linguistical clue is trained with CTC loss.

- Performance of CRNN is boosted from 65.2\%/53.6\%/39.8\% to 65.6\%/53.4\%/39.9\%.
